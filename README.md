**Note & Features:**

---

### Features

#### Highlighting
The `em` tag is used for highlighting text. If you need to italicize text, please use the custom `i` tag instead. 
> In some markdown editor you can use hotkeys to wrap `<em>` for words, like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> in Typora.

#### Image Pasting

Image pasting is supported but not very recommended. When you paste an image, it is converted to a Base64 string, which can be quite large. Pasting multiple images in a "task note" may cause performance issues.

**Why Attachment Links Are Not Used ?**
1. Attachment links are only for previews.
2. The download link for attachments on the preview page is dynamically generated by the server.
3. iFrames are not supported due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions.


Have fun with this little tool :)
